# Evaluation of Smart Grids (scripts)

This repository holds the python algorithm used to create the SHARPE scripts that quantitatively evaluate a fault tree generated by the methodology explained in the paper "Methodology for dependability evaluation of Smart Grids".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and run on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Windows OS
* [SHARPE Tool](https://sharpe.pratt.duke.edu/)
* Python 2.X

### Installing SHARPE and choosing the approach

Firstly, you need to get SHARPE Tool and make a copy of its folder in your C: disk.

There are two ways to reproduce the results of the evaluation method for Smart Grids:

1. Use the python algorithm to see the results in Windows Command Prompt.
2. Use the scripts generated by the algorithm directly in SHARPE Tool.

## Running the tests

If you choose the first approach, clone this repository by executing the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gisliany/lii-system-ft.git App
```

Go to the folder `App` and run the `inputs.py` file:

```bash
cd App
python inputs.py
```

The SHARPE script generated and used will appear in your command prompt, as well as the results of the evaluation. The failure condition of `inputs.py` is using the k-out-of-n gate. More precisely, the failure condition is 1-out-of-5.

If you choose the second approach, download the `scripts` folder in this repository and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd scripts
C:\Sharpe-Gui\sharpe\sharpe.exe kofn_1oo5.txt
```

The second command will call SHARPE in batch mode passing the `kofn_1oo5.txt` file. This tool will execute the commands in the `kofn_1oo5.txt` file and it'll show the same values as in the first approach.
